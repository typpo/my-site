This project serves as either a **very simple** boilerplate to start building an isomorphic application in React.js or as an example of one way that it can be done.

Please see the [walk through](http://jmfurlott.com/tutorial-setting-up-a-simple-isomorphic-react-app/) for a more thorough explanation of the code.

## Stack

- React.js
- Webpack
- Express
- react-router
- Babel

## Installation instructions

In the project's directory, run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

When the servers are started, visit `http://localhost:3000` to see a Hello world page.

## Thanks

While outdated, this repo was heavily inspired by [acdlite](http://github.com/acdlite) and his [demo app for flummox](https://github.com/acdlite/flummox-isomorphic-demo)
