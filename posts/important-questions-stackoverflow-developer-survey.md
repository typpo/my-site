title: Less Important Questions from StackOverflow's Developer Survey

The StackOverflow [post](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/06/15/developers-use-spaces-make-money-use-tabs/) on tabs vs. spaces made quite a splash yesterday with the revelation that people who indent their code with spaces earn more, on average, than people use tabs.

They've made their dataset available for [download](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/06/15/download-stack-overflows-2017-developer-survey-data/) so I wrote a quick script to see what else we can learn about developer salaries.

This is the one we've all been waiting for.

##Ship it?

Fortune favors the bold.

##Clicky keys

You probably should just talk to your officemate instead of using this result.

## Open source helps

Toward this end, I've [open sourced](https://github.com/typpo/stackoverflow-analysis) this analysis.  I still don't really know my way around pandas/Jupyter, so maybe you can do better.
