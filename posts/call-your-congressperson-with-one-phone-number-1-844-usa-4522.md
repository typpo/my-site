I've created a toll-free phone number, <a href="tel:18448720234">**1-844-USA-0234**</a>, that will dial all your members of Congress, no matter where you are.

Instead of having to look up 3+ phone numbers and call them separately, this single number will connect you to your representatives one after another.

The United States is a representative democracy.  If there's a policy you'd like to see changed as a US citizen, ask your senators and representatives to act.

## Does calling Congress actually do anything?

Calling Congress counts for a bit, and it's better than sitting around and complaining, or watching the news and feeling helpless.

When the phone is answered, you'll probably speak to a Staff Assistant who will listen to what you have to say.  **The office keeps track of how many people have positions on the issues, and these numbers influence policy positions.**

Make sure to state what issue you're calling about and why.  Also, you may want to provide your address to prove you're a constituent (and possibly receive a letter in return).

Good luck.  The number **1-844-USA-0234** should be easy enough to save in your phone as "Congress".  The next time you are sick of things being the way they are, give it a shot!
