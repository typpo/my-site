More for my benefit than anyone else's, I've compiled these resources on the August solar eclipse.

# Location

The most detailed interactive map of the eclipse path is available [here](http://xjubier.free.fr/en/site_pages/solar_eclipses/TSE_2017_GoogleMapFull.html).  NASA also has an official [interactive map](https://eclipse2017.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/interactive_map/index.html) of the eclipse path.

Use [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps) street view to figure out where exactly you're going to park and stand.

# Time

The total solar eclipse will last just a few minutes.  Enter the zip code of your observation site in [this calculator](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/7/25/16019892/solar-eclipse-2017-interactive-map) to determine exactly when the moon will cover the sun (this information is also available on the map above).

# Is it going to be cloudy?

Eyeball this [map](https://storage.googleapis.com/mdh-examples/2017-eclipse-clouds/index.html), which is colored by average cloud cover.

Then use [Weatherspark](https://weatherspark.com/) to look at historical cloud cover for your particular location.  Drill down into the cloud diagram and select August 21 to get hour-by-hour historical predictions (example: [Depoe Bay, OR](https://weatherspark.com/d/341/8/21/Average-Weather-on-August-21-in-Depoe-Bay-Oregon-United-States#Sections-Clouds)).
