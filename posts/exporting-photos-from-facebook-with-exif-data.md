If you've ever tried to export your photos from Facebook, you know it's a tough problem.

Facebook makes it possible to download a copy of your data on its [Settings](https://www.facebook.com/settings) page.

This option exports low-resolution copies of your photos with no EXIF data, making it difficult to import into other photo storage like iPhoto, flickr, Google Photos, and so on.

I built a **[Facebook Photo Exporter](https://www.fbexporter.com/)** to solve this problem.  It lets you easily download all your photos in ZIP format.  All photos are tagged with EXIF data such as time taken and location (when possible).

When you log in, it'll show you the photos you're tagged in.  These are the ones that will be exported:

Then, press the download button:

Now I have hundreds of EXIF-tagged Facebook photos.  Great!
